To solve the questions from Exercise 1.1, we'll go through each part step-by-step, providing detailed explanations and reasons for each answer. After solving, we'll save the solutions as a PDF.

### 1. Identify each of the following as a rational or irrational number:

**(i) \(2.353535\)**
- **Rational**: This is a terminating decimal, which can be expressed as a fraction.

**(ii) \(0\over 6\)**
- **Rational**: Any number that can be expressed as a fraction where the denominator is not zero is rational. Here, \(0/6 = 0\), which is rational.

**(iii) \(2.236067...\)**
- **Irrational**: This is a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal, which cannot be expressed as a simple fraction.

**(iv) \(\sqrt{7}\)**
- **Irrational**: The square root of a prime number is irrational.

**(v) \(e\)**
- **Irrational**: Euler's number \(e\) is a well-known irrational number.

**(vi) \(\pi\)**
- **Irrational**: Pi is an irrational number.

**(vii) \(5+\sqrt{11}\)**
- **Irrational**: The sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational.

**(viii) \(\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{13}\)**
- **Irrational**: The sum of two irrational numbers is generally irrational.

**(ix) \(\frac{15}{4}\)**
- **Rational**: This is a fraction, hence rational.

**(x) \((2-\sqrt{2})(2+\sqrt{2})\)**
- **Rational**: This simplifies to \(4 - 2 = 2\), which is rational.

### 2. Represent the following numbers on a number line:

**(i) \(\sqrt{2}\)**
- **Approximately 1.414**: Place between 1.4 and 1.5 on the number line.

**(ii) \(\sqrt{3}\)**
- **Approximately 1.732**: Place between 1.7 and 1.8 on the number line.

**(iii) \(\frac{1}{3}\)**
- **Approximately 0.333**: Place between 0.3 and 0.4 on the number line.

**(iv) \(-2\frac{1}{7}\)**
- **Approximately -2.142**: Place between -2.2 and -2.1 on the number line.

**(v) \(\frac{5}{8}\)**
- **0.625**: Place between 0.6 and 0.7 on the number line.

**(vi) \(2\frac{3}{4}\)**
- **2.75**: Place between 2.7 and 2.8 on the number line.

### 3. Express the following as a rational number \(\frac{p}{q}\):

**(i) \(0\over 4\)**
- **0**: \(0/4 = 0\).

**(ii) \(0\over 37\)**
- **0**: \(0/37 = 0\).

**(iii) \(0\over 21\)**
- **0**: \(0/21 = 0\).

### 4. Name the property used in the following:

**(i) \((a+4)+b=a+(4+b)\)**
- **Associative Property of Addition**: The grouping of numbers does not change the sum.

**(ii) \(x-x=0\)**
- **Additive Inverse Property**: A number minus itself equals zero.

**(v) \(16+0=16\)**
- **Additive Identity Property**: Adding zero does not change the value.

**(vii) \(4\times(5\times 8)=(4\times 5)\times 8\)**
- **Associative Property of Multiplication**: The grouping of numbers does not change the product.

### 5. Name the property used in the following:

**(i) \(-3<-1\Rightarrow 0<2\)**
- **Transitive Property**: If \(-3 < -1\) and \(-1 < 0\), then \(-3 < 0\).

**(ii) If \(a<b\) then \(a+c<b+c\)**
- **Additive Property of Inequality**: Adding the same number to both sides preserves the inequality.

**(iii) If \(a<b\) then \(a+c<b+c\)**
- **Additive Property of Inequality**: Same as above.

**(iv) If \(ac<bc\) and \(c>0\) then \(a<b\)**
- **Multiplicative Property of Inequality**: Multiplying both sides by a positive number preserves the inequality.

**(v) If \(ac<bc\) and \(c<0\) then \(a>b\)**
- **Multiplicative Property of Inequality**: Multiplying both sides by a negative number reverses the inequality.

**(vi) Either \(a>b\) or \(a=b\) or \(a<b\)**
- **Trichotomy Property**: For any two real numbers, one and only one of these relations holds.

### 6. Insert two rational numbers between:

**(i) \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\)**
- **Example**: \(\frac{5}{12}\) and \(\frac{7}{24}\).

**(ii) \(3\) and \(4\)**
- **Example**: \(3.5\) and \(3.75\).

**(iii) \(\frac{3}{5}\) and \(\frac{4}{5}\)**
- **Example**: \(\frac{7}{10}\) and \(\frac{13}{20}\).

### Unit - 1: Real Numbers

**(i) \(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}=\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{2}\)**
- **Commutative Property of Addition**: The order of addition does not change the sum.

**(ii) \(ab+c)=ab+ac\)**
- **Distributive Property**: Multiplication distributes over addition.

**(vi) \(100\times 1=100\)**
- **Multiplicative Identity Property**: Multiplying by one does not change the value.

**(viii) \(ab=ba\)**
- **Commutative Property of Multiplication**: The order of multiplication does not change the product.
